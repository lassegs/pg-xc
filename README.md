# Resources for planning XC paragliding in Norway

This repository contains several data files than can be useful for planning XC trips in Norway in GeoJSON format.
I am working on making the attributes more useful than they currently are. 

By order of usefulness:

* Airspace and lowest ceilings from www.grytnes-it.no/pg/luftrom/
* Slope values for terrain model
* Public cabins from Kartverket N50 data
* Mountain tops from Kartverket N50 data
 * TODO: insert altitude
* Surfaces of water from Kartverket N250 data
 
Less useful:

* Marked trails and ski tracks for Norway from https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no/metadata/uuid/d1422d17-6d95-4ef1-96ab-8af31744dd63
* Some thermal hotspots from thermal.kk7.ch - not much activity is recorded for the North

Planned:

* Elevation and south-facing hillshade models for Norway
